# progressive-web-app-text-editor

## Description
In this challenge we went through and added got the weppack to work by adding the rules for module. This challenge was different from others, in that the "TODO's"
were set out for us. I made changes to the database so it could be accessed by IndexedDB. I mainly used the searchbar to type in keywords surrounding the files with "TODO's" and found that in previous assignments there was generally code that worked well to get everything in working order.

After running npm i, npm run start, I have had the text editor working.
